# PhytoLens-Plant_Disease_Detection_System
PhytoLens is a system or tool that helps farmers and gardeners identify plant diseases early using images of leaves. Just take a photo of the plant leaf, upload it, and the system tells you: 
1. Which disease the plant has  
2. How severe it is  
3. What treatment can be done
